# How to Fix Authentication Issues in GolfBuddies2

## Regular Browser Tab Issues

If you can log in using an incognito/private window but not with your regular browser tab, the issue is likely with cached data in your browser. Follow these steps:

1. Open your regular browser tab to http://localhost:3000
2. Press F12 or right-click and select "Inspect" to open developer tools
3. Go to the "Application" tab in developer tools
4. In the left sidebar, expand "Storage" and select "Local Storage"
5. Select the domain (should be localhost:3000)
6. **Click the "Clear all" button** (looks like a ðŸš« icon) to remove all localStorage items
7. Also check and clear "Session Storage" using the same method
8. If that doesn't work, try clearing cookies as well: expand "Cookies" in the sidebar and delete cookies for localhost

## General Cache Clearing
9. You can also clear your entire browser cache by:
   - In Chrome: Settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data > Check "Cookies and site data" and "Cached images and files"
   - In Firefox: Settings > Privacy & Security > Clear Data > Check "Cookies and Site Data" and "Cached Web Content"

## After Clearing Cache
10. Reload the page by pressing Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R (to bypass cache)
11. Try logging in with these test credentials:
    - Email: john.doe@example.com
    - Password: password123

## If Issues Persist
If you still have issues, open the Console tab in developer tools and paste:
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
console.log("Storage cleared!");
```
Then reload the page.
